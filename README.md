# New Zealand Motor Vehicle Thefts Data Analysis Challenge

## Dataset Overview

This challenge uses data from the New Zealand police department's vehicle of interest database, containing 6 months of stolen vehicle records. 
Each record represents a single stolen vehicle, providing insights into various aspects of vehicle thefts across New Zealand.

### Data Contents

- Vehicle type
- Make
- Year
- Color
- Date stolen
- Region stolen

## Challenge Objective

Your task is to analyze the provided dataset and uncover insights about motor vehicle thefts in New Zealand. 
This analysis will help in understanding patterns and characteristics of vehicle thefts, which could be valuable for law enforcement and public awareness.

## Recommended Analysis Questions

1. **Temporal Patterns**: 
   - What day of the week are vehicles most often and least often stolen?
   - Are there any notable patterns in theft timing (e.g., monthly or seasonal trends)?

2. **Vehicle Characteristics**:
   - What types of vehicles are most often and least often stolen? 
   - Does the popularity of stolen vehicle types vary by region?
   - Is there a correlation between vehicle color and theft frequency?

3. **Vehicle Age Analysis**:
   - What is the average age of the vehicles that are stolen?
   - Does the average age of stolen vehicles vary based on the vehicle type?
   - Is there a trend in the age of stolen vehicles over time?

4. **Regional Analysis**:
   - Which regions have the most and least number of stolen vehicles?
   - What are the characteristics of the regions with high theft rates?
   - Is there a correlation between region size or population and theft rates?

5. **Brand Analysis**:
   - Which vehicle makes are most commonly stolen?
   - Is there a relationship between vehicle make and the region where it's stolen?

## Deliverables

1. A clean, well-commented analysis script (Python, R, or SQL preferred)
2. A summary report of your findings (PDF or Markdown)



## Additional Challenges (Optional)

For those looking to go above and beyond:

1. Predict the likelihood of a vehicle being stolen based on its characteristics
2. Create an interactive dashboard to explore the data
3. Combine this dataset with external data (e.g., population data, income levels) for deeper insights

Good luck, and happy analyzing!
